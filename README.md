# Nonrelativistic Dark Matter-Electron Interactions: EFT Derivation

Gordan Krnjaic, Duncan Rocha, Tanner Trickle

This mathematica notebook implements the NR EFT calculations outlined in 2407.14598. For any UV interaction vertex between dark matter and the SM electron, the functions provided will compute the representative NREFT. Additionally, the coefficients for the NR amplitudes in the basis of 2407.14598 are provided.
